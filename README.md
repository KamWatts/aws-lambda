# AWS Lambda Integration Exercise

The code within this file was created to create an AWS Lambda function that retrives images files and rejects files that are not images. When this function is invoked, it will update the AWS S3 bucket with the file and updates can also be applied to the image bucket. A testing file was also implemented. I utilized test driven development to ensure my file structure is accurate and does the job it is intended for.
